Welcome to my blog! I am a web developer from California. Aside from my coding interests, I enjoy running, typing, and the wonder of plain bagels.

One of my favorite development-related topics is efficiency. I keep searching for new ways to make websites load and function quickly. During this endless search, I will write about my discoveries and their real-world uses in projects. There will also be opinion pieces, poems, and everything else I feel like putting here. There are no limits.

For now, this post serves as a landmark for all future posts to exceed, both in length and in importance. However, if one doesnâ€™t have an introduction, did their blog ever truly begin? This one has, and I hope you enjoy your stay.
