When designing pages, it is easy to get carried away with messy styling. You can see this in many pages across the web: hundreds, sometimes thousands, of unused CSS rules are pumped in. To reduce the load time of a page, we should actively reduce the amount of unnecessary CSS. I like to use SCSS "compositions."

## SCSS

To build compositions, we first need to understand SCSS. Tania Rascia wrote [an excellent post on getting started with Sass and its SCSS counterpart.](https://www.taniarascia.com/learn-sass-now/) SCSS allows, among other things, "linking" between SCSS files through the usage of ```@import```. This naturally encourages an organized folder structure that is focused on building a single CSS file for the website.
